# Plan
Define thresholds: Set thresholds for CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space.
Check system metrics: Use Linux commands to get the current CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes.
Compare metrics against thresholds: If any metric exceeds the predefined threshold, log an alert message.
Log alerts: Write alert messages to the console or a log file.

# Pseudocode
Define threshold values.
Get current CPU usage.
Get current memory usage.
Get current disk space usage.
Get running processes.
Check if any metric exceeds the threshold.
Log an alert if any metric is above the threshold.
